# Component Selection Rationale

**Experiment:** Mach-Zehnder Interferometer

**Timestamp:** 20251124_180921

**Description:** Demonstrates quantum superposition and interference by splitting coherent light into two paths and recombining them to create interference fringes.

## 1. Coherent Laser

HeNe laser at 632.8nm provides stable, coherent light source necessary for high-visibility interference - coherence length must exceed path difference

## 2. Input BS

50:50 beam splitter creates equal amplitude superposition of photon being in upper and lower arms simultaneously

## 3. Upper Mirror

Redirects upper arm beam back toward output beam splitter while maintaining beam alignment and optical path

## 4. Lower Mirror

Redirects lower arm beam back toward output beam splitter, completing the interferometer geometry

## 5. Phase Control

Adjustable phase shifter (piezo mirror or glass plate) enables scanning of relative phase between arms to observe interference fringes

## 6. Output BS

Second 50:50 beam splitter recombines the two arms, enabling quantum interference between the superposed paths

## 7. Detector 1

Photodiode measures transmitted output intensity, showing constructive/destructive interference as phase is varied

## 8. Detector 2

Second photodiode at reflected output port demonstrates complementary interference pattern - when Det1 is bright, Det2 is dark
