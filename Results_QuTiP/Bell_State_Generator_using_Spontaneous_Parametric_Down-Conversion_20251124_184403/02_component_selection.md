---

## 1. 405nm Pump Laser

Provides blue pump photons with sufficient energy to generate two 810nm photons through energy conservation in SPDC process

## 2. Focusing Lens

Focuses pump beam into BBO crystal to increase interaction strength and SPDC conversion efficiency

## 3. BBO Crystal

Type-II Beta Barium Borate crystal generates entangled photon pairs where signal and idler have orthogonal polarizations

## 4. Pump Block Filter

Removes residual 405nm pump light immediately after crystal to prevent it from reaching detectors

## 5. Mirror 1

Redirects the upper cone of SPDC photons to create spatial separation between signal and idler beams

## 6. Mirror 2

Redirects the lower cone of SPDC photons to create the second distinct beam path for the idler photon

## 7. Collection Lens 1

Collects and collimates the signal photon in the upper path after mirror reflection

## 8. Collection Lens 2

Collects and collimates the idler photon in the lower path after mirror reflection

## 9. Polarizer A

Set at 45° to project photon A onto diagonal polarization basis for Bell state measurement

## 10. Polarizer B

Set at 45° to project photon B onto diagonal polarization basis for Bell state measurement

## 11. Bandpass Filter A

Narrow bandpass filter to select 810nm SPDC photons and eliminate background noise

## 12. Bandpass Filter B

Narrow bandpass filter to select 810nm SPDC photons and eliminate background noise

## 13. Coupling Lens A

Focuses photons onto the active area of SPAD detector A for efficient detection

## 14. Coupling Lens B

Focuses photons onto the active area of SPAD detector B for efficient detection

## 15. SPAD Detector A

Single-photon avalanche photodiode with precise timing for coincidence detection of entangled photons

## 16. SPAD Detector B

Second SPAD detector enabling coincidence counting to verify quantum correlations and Bell inequality violation
