**Description:** Demonstrates retroactive erasure of which-path information using entangled photons and delayed measurement choices.

---

## 1. Pump Laser

405nm laser provides pump photons for SPDC process to generate entangled pairs

## 2. BBO Crystal

Type-II SPDC crystal creates entangled photon pairs with orthogonal polarizations (H,V)

## 3. Signal Mirror

Directs signal photons toward the double-slit interference setup

## 4. Idler Mirror

Directs idler photons toward the delayed eraser measurement path

## 5. Double Slit

Creates potential for interference pattern in signal photons

## 6. Upper Slit Polarizer

Positioned after upper slit aperture to mark path with horizontal polarization

## 7. Lower Slit Polarizer

Positioned after lower slit aperture to mark path with vertical polarization

## 8. Imaging Lens

Focuses the double-slit pattern onto the signal detector screen

## 9. Signal Detector

Records signal photon arrivals with precise timing for coincidence analysis

## 10. Long Delay Line

Ensures idler measurement occurs after signal photon detection (delayed choice)

## 11. Eraser BS

Splits idler beam to create choice between different measurement bases

## 12. Eraser Polarizer 1

45° polarizer erases which-path information by measuring in diagonal basis

## 13. Eraser Polarizer 2

135° polarizer also erases which-path information in complementary diagonal basis

## 14. Eraser Detector 1

Detects idler photons after path-erasing measurement

## 15. Eraser Detector 2

Detects idler photons after complementary path-erasing measurement
