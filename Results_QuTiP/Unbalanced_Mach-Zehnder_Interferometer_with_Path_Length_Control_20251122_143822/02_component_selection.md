## 1. HeNe Laser

Provides stable, coherent 632.8nm light with sufficient coherence length for the unequal arm lengths in this asymmetric design

## 2. Input BS

50:50 cube beam splitter creates equal amplitude superposition of photon being in upper and lower interferometer arms

## 3. Upper Mirror

Redirects upper arm beam toward delay stage, creating the shorter interferometer path

## 4. Delay Stage

Motorized translation stage provides precise control of optical path difference between arms for phase tuning and fringe scanning

## 5. Lower Mirror 1

First mirror in extended lower arm path, creating the longer baseline for increased sensitivity

## 6. Lower Mirror 2

Second mirror completing the extended lower arm geometry before recombination

## 7. Output BS

Recombines the two interferometer arms, enabling quantum interference between the path amplitudes

## 8. Detector 1

Measures transmitted interference output, showing complementary fringes to reflected output

## 9. Detector 2

Measures reflected interference output, demonstrating conservation of photon probability between ports
