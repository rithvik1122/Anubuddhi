  "physics_explanation": "An unknown quantum state |\u03c8\u27e9 = \u03b1|H\u27e9 + \u03b2|V\u27e9 is prepared on photon A using the state preparation laser and wave plate. Simultaneously, entangled photons B and C are created via SPDC in the |\u03a6+\u27e9 = (|HH\u27e9 + |VV\u27e9)/\u221a2 Bell state. A Bell state measurement on photons A and B at the polarizing beam splitter projects their joint state, which instantaneously transforms photon C into the original state |\u03c8\u27e9 up to a known Pauli operation. Classical communication of the Bell measurement outcome enables real-time correction of photon C using programmable wave plates, completing the faithful teleportation of the unknown quantum state.",
