# Component Selection Rationale

**Experiment:** Michelson Interferometer

**Timestamp:** 20251124_190302

**Description:** Creates interference fringes by splitting a coherent beam into two perpendicular arms and recombining them to measure phase differences.

---

## 1. HeNe Laser

Provides highly coherent 632.8nm light with long coherence length necessary for stable interference fringes

## 2. Beam Expander

Increases beam diameter to create larger, more visible interference patterns and reduces beam divergence

## 3. 50:50 Beam Splitter

Splits incident beam into equal intensity arms and recombines returning beams for interference

## 4. Fixed Mirror M1

Reflects horizontal arm beam back toward beam splitter with high reflectivity to maintain intensity

## 5. Movable Mirror M2

Piezo-controlled mirror allows precise path length adjustment to scan through interference fringes

## 6. Interference Screen

Displays the resulting interference pattern as bright and dark fringes that shift with mirror movement
