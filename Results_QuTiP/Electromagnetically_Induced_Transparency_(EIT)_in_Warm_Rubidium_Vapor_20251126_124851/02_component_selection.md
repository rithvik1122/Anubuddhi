## 1. Probe Laser

Weak 795nm laser tuned to Rb-87 D1 line (5S1/2 F=2 → 5P1/2) - scanned across resonance to observe EIT transparency window

## 2. Probe AOM

Acousto-optic modulator allows scanning probe laser frequency across atomic resonance to map out EIT lineshape and locate two-photon resonance

## 3. Probe HWP

Half-wave plate rotates probe polarization to optimize coupling to specific atomic transitions and ensure proper alignment with coupling beam polarization

## 4. Probe Polarizer

Ensures clean linear polarization of probe beam for well-defined atomic transition selection and coherent interaction

## 5. Probe Collimator

Expands and collimates probe beam to match coupling beam diameter ensuring uniform interaction region through vapor cell

## 6. Coupling Laser

Strong 780nm laser on D2 line (5S1/2 F=1 → 5P3/2) creates dressed states and induces transparency for probe beam through quantum interference

## 7. Coupling HWP

Controls coupling beam polarization for proper atomic transition selection rules in co-propagating geometry with probe

## 8. Coupling Polarizer

Purifies coupling beam polarization to maintain coherent interaction with atoms and prevent decoherence

## 9. Coupling Collimator

Collimates coupling beam for extended interaction length through vapor cell and ensures spatial overlap with probe

## 10. Beam Combiner

Dichroic mirror combines probe (795nm transmitted) and coupling (780nm reflected) beams collinearly - critical for EIT as beams must spatially overlap

## 11. Alignment Iris

Ensures precise spatial overlap of probe and coupling beams through vapor cell for maximum EIT effect

## 12. Rb-87 Vapor Cell

Contains warm rubidium-87 atoms providing Lambda-type three-level system with ground state hyperfine splitting of 6.8 GHz matching two-photon resonance condition

## 13. Collection Lens

Focuses transmitted probe light onto detector for maximum signal collection efficiency

## 14. Probe Filter

Narrowband filter centered at 795nm blocks scattered coupling light while transmitting probe, preventing detector saturation from strong coupling beam

## 15. Probe Detector

Silicon photodiode measures probe beam transmission as function of detuning to observe narrow EIT transparency peak

## 16. Lock-in Amplifier

Electronic readout providing sensitive phase-locked detection of probe transmission signal, improving signal-to-noise ratio for observing narrow EIT features

## 17. Cell Heater

Electronic temperature controller regulates vapor cell at 40-60°C to control atomic vapor density - higher temperature increases atom number but also Doppler broadening

## 18. RF Generator

Electronic RF source driving AOM at 80MHz to scan probe frequency and can provide modulation for lock-in detection of EIT signal
