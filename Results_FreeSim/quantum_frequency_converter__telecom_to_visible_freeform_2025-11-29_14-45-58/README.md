## Experiment Description

Converts single photons from telecom wavelength (1550nm) to visible (630nm) using sum-frequency generation in PPLN waveguide while preserving quantum coherence

---

## Physics Background

Single telecom photons at 1550nm undergo sum-frequency generation (SFG) with a strong 980nm pump field in a PPLN waveguide crystal, producing upconverted photons at 630nm (visible red). The process |ω_telecom⟩ + |ω_pump⟩ → |ω_signal⟩ preserves quantum coherence and entanglement through the parametric interaction χ⁽²⁾. Quasi-phase-matching via periodic poling compensates for momentum mismatch, enabling efficient conversion while maintaining single-photon characteristics. Multiple dichroic mirrors and spectral filters remove unconverted photons and pump light, isolating the converted visible photons for detection with high-efficiency silicon SPADs.
