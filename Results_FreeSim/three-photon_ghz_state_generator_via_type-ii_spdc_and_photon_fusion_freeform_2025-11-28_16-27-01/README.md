## Experiment Description

Generates three-photon Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger entangled states using dual SPDC sources with polarization-preserving photon fusion

---

## Physics Background

Two independent Type-II SPDC sources each produce entangled pairs in state (|HV⟩ + |VH⟩)/√2. The H-polarized photons from both sources are directed to a polarizing beam splitter (fusion PBS) where they undergo Hong-Ou-Mandel interference. When both H photons exit together to detector C (post-selected event), the V-polarized photons at detectors A and B become entangled with the fused photon, creating the three-photon GHZ state |GHZ⟩ = (|VVH⟩ + |HHV⟩)/√2 through entanglement swapping and quantum interference.

## Design Alignment Assessment

**Alignment Score:** 8/10
**Converged:** Yes (in 3 iteration(s))
