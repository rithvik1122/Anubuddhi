## Experiment Description

Teleports an unknown quantum polarization state from Alice to Bob using entangled photon pairs, Bell state measurement, and classical communication

---

## Physics Background

Type-I SPDC generates entangled photon pairs in Bell state |Φ+⟩ = (|HH⟩ + |VV⟩)/√2, with one photon sent to Alice and one to Bob. Alice prepares unknown state |ψ⟩ = α|H⟩ + β|V⟩ and performs Bell state measurement by interfering it with her entangled photon at a 50:50 non-polarizing beam splitter (enabling Hong-Ou-Mandel interference), followed by polarization analysis with two PBSs and four detectors. The two-photon coincidence pattern projects onto one of four Bell states, collapsing Bob's photon into a state related to |ψ⟩ by a known Pauli operator. Electronic coincidence logic identifies the Bell state and transmits classical bits via RF/fiber to Bob's station, triggering Pockels cells to apply the appropriate correction (identity, σ_x, σ_z, or σ_xσ_z), recovering the exact original state.
