## Experiment Description

Teleports coherent state quantum information using EPR-entangled squeezed vacuum beams and homodyne detection with feedforward correction

---

## Physics Background

Two PPLN crystals generate squeezed vacuum states via optical parametric amplification, which are combined with π/2 phase difference to create EPR-entangled beams shared between Alice and Bob. Alice interferes the input coherent state (carrying information to teleport) with her EPR mode on a 50:50 beam splitter, producing two outputs that are each measured with separate balanced homodyne detectors (one for X quadrature, one for P quadrature) using phase-controlled local oscillator beams. The measurement results are electronically processed by feedforward electronics that apply displacement operations (gain G=√2) to Bob's EPR mode via EOMs, reconstructing the input state. Bob's homodyne detector verifies the teleported state by measuring the displaced mode.
