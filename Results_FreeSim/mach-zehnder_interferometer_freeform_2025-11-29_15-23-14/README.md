## Experiment Description

Creates interference fringes by splitting a coherent beam into two parallel arms and recombining them to measure phase differences and demonstrate wave-particle duality

---

## Physics Background

A coherent laser beam enters the first 50:50 beam splitter (BS1) which creates a quantum superposition |ψ⟩ = (|upper⟩ + i|lower⟩)/√2. The two paths traverse different optical path lengths, with the upper arm containing a tunable phase shifter that introduces a relative phase φ. At the second beam splitter (BS2), the paths recombine and interfere, producing complementary intensity patterns at the two output ports following I₁ ∝ cos²(φ/2) and I₂ ∝ sin²(φ/2). This demonstrates quantum interference and the wave nature of light, with visibility approaching 100% for perfect coherence.

## Design Alignment Assessment

**Alignment Score:** 9/10
**Converged:** Yes (in 1 iteration(s))
