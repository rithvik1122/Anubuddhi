## Experiment Description

Demonstrates retroactive erasure of which-path information using entangled photons where the choice to measure or erase path information occurs after detection of the signal photon.

---

## Physics Background

Type-II SPDC creates momentum-entangled signal-idler photon pairs. Signal photons pass through a double slit creating spatial superposition, while idler photons propagate along two distinct paths (A or B) correlated with which slit the signal photon passed through due to momentum conservation. Each idler path encounters a beam splitter: BS_A and BS_B allow direct transmission to D1 and D2 (preserving which-path information), or reflection toward BS_Eraser where paths A and B interfere quantum mechanically before detection at D3 or D4 (erasing which-path information). Coincidence counting between D0 and idler detectors retroactively determines whether interference appears at D0, demonstrating complementarity and delayed choice since the erasure decision occurs after signal detection.
