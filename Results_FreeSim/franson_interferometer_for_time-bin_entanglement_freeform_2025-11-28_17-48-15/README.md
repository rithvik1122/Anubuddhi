## Experiment Description

Demonstrates energy-time entanglement using unbalanced Mach-Zehnder interferometers in each arm to create and measure time-bin entangled photon pairs

---

## Physics Background

The 405nm pump creates entangled photon pairs at 810nm via Type-II SPDC in PPLN crystal, with energy-time entanglement where the pair creation time is quantum mechanically uncertain. The PBS separator uses orthogonal polarizations from Type-II SPDC to spatially separate signal and idler photons into upper and lower paths. Each photon enters an unbalanced Mach-Zehnder interferometer with path length difference ΔL creating a time delay Δt = ΔL/c. When Δt exceeds the photon coherence time but is less than the pump coherence time, individual photons show no interference, but coincidence counts exhibit two-photon interference fringes as phases φ_S and φ_I are varied, violating the CHSH inequality and confirming energy-time entanglement in the state |ψ⟩ = (|early,early⟩ + e^(iφ)|late,late⟩)/√2. The detectors convert photon arrivals to electronic signals that feed into the coincidence counter for correlation analysis.
