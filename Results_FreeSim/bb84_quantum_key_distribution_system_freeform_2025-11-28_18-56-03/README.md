## Experiment Description

Implements the BB84 protocol for secure quantum key distribution using polarization-encoded single photons transmitted between Alice and Bob

---

## Physics Background

Alice's encoder prepares single photons in one of four polarization states (H, V, +45°, -45°) by randomly selecting basis (rectilinear or diagonal) and bit value (0 or 1). The 50:50 beam splitter at Bob's side randomly routes photons to either rectilinear measurement (PBS measuring H/V directly) or diagonal measurement (HWP rotation followed by PBS). After transmission, Alice and Bob use the classical channel to publicly compare basis choices and retain only matching-basis events (basis sifting). Security relies on quantum no-cloning theorem: any eavesdropper measuring the photons introduces detectable errors (increased QBER) due to measurement-induced disturbance, as measuring in the wrong basis projects the state randomly and destroys the original information.
