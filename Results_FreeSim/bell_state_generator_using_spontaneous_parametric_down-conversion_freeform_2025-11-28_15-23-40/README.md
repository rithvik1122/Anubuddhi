## Experiment Description

Generates maximally entangled photon pairs in Bell states using Type-II SPDC in a BBO crystal with proper beam separation and polarization analysis.

---

## Physics Background

A 405nm pump laser undergoes Type-II SPDC in a BBO crystal, generating entangled photon pairs at 810nm where one photon has horizontal polarization and the other vertical. The crystal creates the Bell state |ψ⟩ = (|H⟩A|V⟩B + |V⟩A|H⟩B)/√2 due to conservation laws. Mirrors separate the SPDC cone into distinct spatial paths, and polarizers at 45° project both photons onto the same diagonal basis, enabling violation of Bell inequalities through coincidence measurements.

## Design Alignment Assessment

**Alignment Score:** 3/10
**Converged:** No (in 3 iteration(s))
