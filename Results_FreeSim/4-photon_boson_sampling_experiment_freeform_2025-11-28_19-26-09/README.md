## Experiment Description

Demonstrates quantum computational advantage by interfering 4 indistinguishable photons through a 5-mode linear optical network and measuring output statistics that are classically hard to simulate.

---

## Physics Background

Four indistinguishable single photons from two SPDC sources are injected into modes 1-4 of a 5-mode linear optical network (mode 5 is vacuum). The photons undergo quantum interference according to the permanent of the unitary matrix describing the network, creating a multi-photon output distribution. The probability of measuring any specific output configuration is given by |Per(U_S)|²/(n!m!), where U_S is the submatrix corresponding to input/output modes - a calculation that is #P-hard and classically intractable. Measuring the output distribution with single-photon detectors and 4-fold coincidence counting demonstrates quantum computational advantage, as classical computers cannot efficiently sample from this distribution.
