## Experiment Description

Generates photon pairs hyperentangled in both polarization and orbital angular momentum using cascaded Type-I SPDC crystals with spatial mode conversion

---

## Physics Background

A 405nm pump laser with diagonal polarization is split by PBS into H-polarized (upper path) and V-polarized (lower path) components. Each path contains a Type-I BBO crystal generating degenerate photon pairs at 810nm with identical polarization (HH pairs in upper crystal, VV pairs in lower crystal). The SLMs on each path encode spatial superposition states (|LG+ℓ⟩+|LG-ℓ⟩)/√2 onto both photons in each pair before the paths recombine at the non-polarizing beam splitter. This creates the hyperentangled state |Ψ⟩ = (|HH⟩+|VV⟩)/√2 ⊗ (|+ℓ,+ℓ⟩+|-ℓ,-ℓ⟩)/√2, where polarization entanglement arises from path indistinguishability after recombination and OAM entanglement from correlated spatial mode encoding. The PBS Analysis and OAM sorters enable independent measurement of both degrees of freedom.
