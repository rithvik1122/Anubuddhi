## Experiment Description

Demonstrates quantum interference effects in a three-level Λ-system where a strong coupling laser renders the medium transparent to a weak probe laser at two-photon resonance

---

## Physics Background

The experiment creates a three-level Λ-system in Rb-87 atoms where both the probe and coupling lasers (780nm D2 line) couple different ground state hyperfine levels 5S_1/2(F=1) and 5S_1/2(F=2) to the same excited state 5P_3/2. Quantum interference between the two excitation pathways creates a coherent dark state |D⟩ = (Ωc|F=1⟩ - Ωp|F=2⟩)/√(|Ωc|² + |Ωp|²) that cannot absorb probe photons. When both lasers satisfy the two-photon resonance condition (δ_probe + δ_coupling = 0), destructive interference eliminates absorption and the medium becomes transparent to the probe (EIT window), accompanied by steep dispersion causing dramatic group velocity reduction. The transparency width is determined by the coupling Rabi frequency Ωc, and the effect vanishes when the coupling laser is blocked, restoring normal absorption.
