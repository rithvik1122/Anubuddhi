## Experiment Description

Generates quadrature-squeezed vacuum states using a sub-threshold optical parametric oscillator with balanced homodyne detection for squeezing verification

---

## Physics Background

A sub-threshold optical parametric oscillator (OPO) operating below threshold generates squeezed vacuum states through degenerate parametric down-conversion in a PPLN crystal. The 532nm pump creates correlated photon pairs at 1064nm within the doubly-resonant cavity, producing quantum noise reduction in one quadrature at the expense of increased noise in the conjugate quadrature. Balanced homodyne detection with a phase-controlled local oscillator measures the quadrature noise spectrum, revealing squeezing below the shot noise limit when the LO phase is optimized. The Pound-Drever-Hall lock maintains cavity resonance for stable squeezing generation using a polarization-based optical circulator scheme.
