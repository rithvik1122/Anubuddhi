## Experiment Description

Creates interference fringes by splitting a coherent beam into two perpendicular arms and recombining them to measure phase differences.

---

## Physics Background

Coherent laser light is split into two perpendicular arms by a 50:50 beam splitter. Each beam reflects from a mirror and returns to the beam splitter where they interfere. The relative phase between the arms depends on the optical path difference, creating constructive or destructive interference patterns. Moving one mirror changes the path length and shifts the fringe pattern.

## Design Alignment Assessment

**Alignment Score:** 8/10
**Converged:** Yes (in 2 iteration(s))
