## Simulation Report

The `03_simulation_report.md` file is a **self-contained report** with:
- Complete simulation output
- **All figures embedded directly** (1 figure(s) included as base64 images)
- LLM analysis of physics correctness
- Design alignment assessment
- Key findings and recommendations

**Note:** The report can be viewed in any markdown viewer (VS Code, GitHub, etc.) and all figures will display inline. Figures are also available separately in the `figures/` folder.

This report combines the simulation results with AI-powered analysis to help you understand:
- Whether the simulation accurately models the designed experiment
- Physics correctness and validity of results
- Suggestions for improvement

## Experiment Description

Demonstrates two-photon quantum interference where indistinguishable photons bunch at a beam splitter, creating a characteristic dip in coincidence counts

---

## Physics Background

Type-II SPDC in BBO crystal generates orthogonally polarized photon pairs at 810nm from 405nm pump photons. The PBS spatially separates signal (H-polarized) and idler (V-polarized) photons into upper and lower arms. Half-wave plates rotate both polarizations to the same state, making photons indistinguishable. When path lengths are matched at the 50:50 beam splitter, quantum interference causes both photons to bunch and exit through the same port due to bosonic statistics, creating a characteristic dip in coincidence counts. The delay stage scans the relative arrival time, revealing the two-photon interference pattern with visibility determined by photon indistinguishability.
