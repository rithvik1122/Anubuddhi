## Experiment Description

Demonstrates quantum teleportation by transferring an unknown quantum state from Alice to Bob using entanglement and classical communication

---

## Physics Background

The experiment implements quantum teleportation using three photons: photon 1 (unknown state prepared by Alice at 810nm), and photons 2 and 3 (entangled Bell pair from SPDC at 810nm). Alice performs a Bell state measurement on photons 1 and 2 using a non-polarizing 50:50 beam splitter for Hong-Ou-Mandel interference, followed by polarizing beam splitters and four detectors that project onto Bell states. This measurement collapses Bob's photon 3 into a state related to the original photon 1 by a known unitary transformation. Alice sends her measurement result (which detector fired) via classical channel to Bob, who applies the corresponding correction using motorized waveplates to recover the exact original state. The protocol demonstrates that quantum information can be transferred without physically sending the quantum particle, using entanglement as a resource and classical communication to complete the transfer.
